Overview

I am a Python architect, educator, and author with over 5 years of sustained contributions to the Python ecosystem through technical writing, conference speaking, mentoring, proposal reviewing, and applied research. My work focuses on building real-world data and AI systems using Python and helping engineers understand complex topics such as distributed data processing, semantic search, matching engines, and performance optimization. Below is the summary of my contributions 

# Book 
Optimizing PySpark Jobs: Real-World Scenarios to Master Logical Plans
Published by freeCodeCamp – February 2026

I am the author of a practical, engineer-focused book that teaches how Apache Spark actually works under the hood and how to optimize PySpark jobs in real-world production environments. The book covers:

Spark Catalyst optimizer internals

Logical and physical execution plans

Column pruning and filter pushdown techniques

Shuffle tuning and partition strategies

Performance optimization patterns in AWS Glue and distributed environments

Real-world scenarios drawn from large-scale data engineering systems

This book is designed to help engineers move beyond syntax and develop a deep understanding of Spark’s execution model, enabling them to diagnose slow jobs, reduce infrastructure costs, and design efficient pipelines in production.
